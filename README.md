# SPD-Sprints
Submissions for Sprint assignments 1, 2, and 3.

Spring 1 (Project Idea):
specific audio file shuffler:
We have music players, streaming services, and shuffling apps; however they do not allow the use to fine tune and selectively choose what to shuffle without making dozens of playlists that you choose yourself. This could created applications for educational and entertainment purposes, as music and podcasts can be used alike.

Sprint 1 (User Journey):

Josephine, a middle school orchestra teacher, might create a playlist called MSorchestra.txt and it would have categories like “allegro”, “romantic”,”baroque”,”mozart”. These categories may be used at the beginning of her class to get her students ready for the type of music that they will be working on that week.

Curtis, an elementary school gym teacher has a whole year of units planned out. He makes a whole playlist of the entire year’s units. The categories are “basketball”, “football”, “jumprope”, “gymnastics”, and more!
